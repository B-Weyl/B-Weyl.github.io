# Overview of Advent of Code

For those who are not familiar with the Advent of Code, it is a coding competetion put together by Eric Wastl. The competetion lasts December 1st through December 25th and features a two part coding challenge each day. The challenges typically follow a storyline and vary in difficulty from widely used algorithms to more challenging thought provoking problems. There is a leaderboard that trackd the top 100 people to complete both parts one and two of each daily challenge. From my experience this year, the usual solve time for each problem is somewhere between 5-10 minutes.

# My Participation in the Advent

While I was not able to complete all challenges at the time that they were released (chanllenges opened at 12 AM EST), I did enjoy in completing the challenges that I was able to make time for. I plan on eventually making my way back around to the other challenges and completing them. I used Python to complete the challenges since that is the langauge I felt the most comfrotable using. Python was also a widely used langauge due to it's simplicity and its ability to be written and executed quickly. In total, I completed 12 of the 25 challenges that were released this year, earning a total of 24 stars.

I plan on uploading a few more additional blog posts that contain my coding solutions as well as my thought process that went into solving each problem. I also have the intention of going back through the current year and use a language that I am less familiar with. As of right now that will most likely be in Rust, since I would like to pick up a language like Rust or C or F# that is more systems related.
