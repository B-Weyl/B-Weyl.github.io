<p> Hello ! </p>

<p> I am Brian Weyl, a Computer Engineer and Application Developer. I currently work as a Mainframe Application Developer for HM Health Solutions using COBOL and JCL. I am self taught in these lauanges since they are not generally taught in colleges anymore. When I am not writing COBOL I thoroughly enjoy using Python to create side projects. I have a deep interest in data analysis and most of my personal projects reflect that.</p>

<p>When I am not working I enjoy being outdoors either running, hiking, or exploring with my dog, Bodie.</p>

<p>If you would like to get in contact with me, please do so either via Linkedin or the email at the bottom of the page.</p>
