<p> Hello ! </p>

<p> I am Brian Weyl, a Computer Engineer and Application Developer. I am currently seeking job opportunities as a software engineer. I worked the past ~5 years writing COBOL, JCL, and working with DB2 databases. While I loved the challenge of tackling a suite of languages that were new to me (at the time), I thoroughly enjoy using Python to create side projects with a deep interest in data analysis. I would love to be able to land a position that would afford me time to learn and gain professional work experience as a Python software engineer. I am currently working on analyzing and displaying data from restaurant inspections in the state of Delaware.</p>

<p>When I am not working I enjoy being outdoors either running, hiking, or exploring with my dog, [Bodie](https://www.instagram.com/bodiethepupper) .</p>

<p>If you would like to get in contact with me, please do so either via Linkedin or the email at the bottom of the page.</p>
