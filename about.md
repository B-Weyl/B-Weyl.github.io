<p> Hello ! </p>

<p> I am Brian Weyl, a Computer Engineer and Application Developer. I am currently working as a Senior Mainframe developer. I have worked the past ~8 years writing COBOL, JCL, and working with DB2 databases. Although I spend most of my time working on mainframe programs, I still try to take advantage of other tools when available, whether that be writing powershell scripts to parse data or writing Python to parse and format data. </p>

<p>When I am not working I enjoy being outdoors. I am an amateur wildlife and nature photographer who enjoys photographing mammals such as foxes and raccoons as well as birds of prey such as Eagles, Hawks, Owls, and Heron. A portfolio of my work is available [here](https://bweylphotos.myportfolio.com/). </p>

<p>If you would like to get in contact with me, please do so either via Linkedin or the email at the bottom of the page.</p>
