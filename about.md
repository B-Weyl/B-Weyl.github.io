<p> Hello ! </p>

<p> I am Brian Weyl, a Computer Engineer and Application Developer. I am currently seeking job opportunities as a software engineer. I thoroughly enjoy using Python to create side projects with a deep interest in data analysis. Most of my personal projects reflect that. I am currently working on creating an application that makes viewing restaurant inspection reports more accessible.</p>

<p>When I am not working I enjoy being outdoors either running, hiking, or exploring with my dog, Bodie.</p>

<p>If you would like to get in contact with me, please do so either via Linkedin or the email at the bottom of the page.</p>
